# Autocon2 CI/CD Workshop Development Repository

>[!NOTE]
> Use this repository to collaborately devlope content before publishing to user. 

Hello! Welcome to [Autocon2 CI/CD workshop](https://networkautomation.forum/autocon2#workshop) proctored by [Eric Chou](https://github.com/ericchou1/), [Jeff Kala](https://github.com/jeffkala), and assisted by [Tim Fiola](https://github.com/tim-fiola). 

You can find the different lab instructions in each of the folders in this repository. 

- [Lab 1. Basic Git Operations](./Lab_1_Basic_Git_Operations/README.md)
- [Lab 2. First Pipeline](./Lab_2_First_Pipeline/README.md)
- [Lab 3. Build Reviews](./Lab_3_Build_Reviews/README.md)
- [Lab 4. Configuration Generation with Templates](./Lab_4_Configuration_Generation_with_Templates/README.md)
- [Lab 5. ACL Change](./Lab_5_ACL_Change/README.md)
- [Lab 6. Testing Frameworks](./Lab_6_Testing_Frameworks/README.md)

But first things first, we would like to walk you through how to set up the development environment for the workshop.

## Lab Components

Here is an overview of lab:   

![Lab_Diagram_v1](images/Lab_Diagram_v1.drawio.png)

Here are the details regarding each components: 

- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/): We will use the SaaS version of GitLab as the CI server. The CI server handles the committing, building, testing, staging, and releasing the changes. 
- [GitLab Runners](https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/): GitLab runners are workers that registers itself with the GitLab server and managed by the GitLab server. They are responsible to carry out the instructions by the GitLab server. 
- [GitHub Codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces): We will use GitHub codepsace as our IDE as well as the virtual server to run our network lab. GitHub provides these container-based development environment for developers. We will use Containerlab to run a few network devices for our lab. GitHub offer a generous free tier in Codespace that should remain to be free for the furation of this lab. 
- [Containerlab](https://containerlab.dev/): We will use containerlab for our lab devices running inside of codepsace.  
- [Arista cEOS](https://containerlab.dev/manual/kinds/ceos/): We will use Arista cEOS for our lab for their light overhead and relative high adaption in production networks. 

## GitLab Account Registration and cEOS Download

Please do the following steps to set up the lab: 

1. Register for a free GitLab.com account [here](https://gitlab.com/users/sign_up) if you do not have one. For a new registration, a project name is required, you can use a temp name or 'Autocon_Lab1' as that is one of the project we will create later: 

![gitlab_account_signup](images/gitlab_account_signup.png)

2. Download the free Arista cEOS image [here](https://www.arista.com/en/login). The image is free but you do need to register an Arista account with your business email. We will import the Arista image Codespace later. 

![arista_download_1](images/arista_download_1.png)

Please download images later than 4.28. We will use 4.32.0F for our lab. 

![arista_downaload_2](images/arista_download_2.png)

> [!TIP]
You just need to download the image for now, for reference here is the import instruction from [containerlab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJMVH2okO24) and a nice walk through video from [Roman](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJMVH2okO24). 

### Lab Setup

Alright, now it is time to tie everything together. 

1. In this repository, we can start Codespace by going to Code button on the top left corner and choose 'Create codespace on main': 

![codespace_start](images/codespace_start.png)

> [!TIP] 
> It will take a bit of time to build codespace for the first time, you can click on [building codespace](images/building_codespace.png) to check on the progress. After it started for the first time, when you stop/start the instance it will be much faster. 

Once Codespace is started, we can verify both Docker and containerlab are installed and running: 

```
@ericchou1 ➜ /workspaces/autocon2-cicd-workshop-dev (main) $ poetry --version
Poetry (version 1.8.4)

@ericchou1 ➜ /workspaces/autocon2-cicd-workshop-dev (main) $ docker run hello-world
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world

@ericchou1 ➜ /workspaces/autocon2-cicd-workshop-dev (main) $ containerlab version

    version: 0.58.0
     commit: 2c249b2c
       date: 2024-10-15T11:38:50Z
     source: https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab
 rel. notes: https://containerlab.dev/rn/0.58/
```

2. After codespace is started, right click in the Explorer section and choose upload: 

![upload_ceos](images/upload_ceos.png)

3. Use command ```docker import cEOS64.<version>.tar.xz ceos:<version>``` to import the image, for example: 

``docker import cEOS64-lab-4.32.0F.tar ceos:4.32.0F``

4. Create GitLab Project

Let's create a GitLab Project: 

![create_gitlab_project](images/create_gitlab_project.png)

Choose Blank Project: 

![create_blank_project](images/create_blank_project.png)

Pick a name for the project: 

![gitlab_autocon_lab1](images/gitlab_autocon_lab1.png)


5. Register GitLab Runner (screenshot following the steps): 
    - Under the GitLab project you created, get runner token via Project -> Settings -> CI/CD -> Project Runners. 
    - When creating this runner, we will use tags to specify the jobs this runner can pickup. 
    - Copy the command on the screen to register the runner. 
    - Come back to the Codespace instance. 
    - Register runner via the following command ```gitlab-runner register  --url https://gitlab.com  --token <token>```
    - Use ```shell``` as the executor 
    - Start the runner with ```gitlab-runner run```

That is it, having gone thru the steps will ensure we can jump right into the workshop lab at Autocon2. 

Below is an optional step for those who are somewhat familiar with Gitlab and want to check the end-to-end setup. 

## (Optional) Checking for end-to-end Lab Setup

This is complete optional and we will go over it in the workshop as our first lab, but if you are up for some testing, we can test the end-to-end lab setup with the following steps. 

- Start containerlab

```
@ericchou1 ➜ /workspaces/autocon2-cicd-workshop-dev/clab (main) $ sudo containerlab deploy --topo ceos-lab.clab.yml

+---+---------+--------------+--------------+------+---------+---------------+--------------+
```
 - Create a test project with the following CI file .gitlab-ci.yml

 ```
stages: 
  - deploy

deploy testing:
  image: "python:3.10"
  stage: deploy
  tags: 
    - "ericchou-1"
  script: 
    - pip3 install nornir_utils nornir_netmiko
    - python3 show_version.py
 ```

- Create the following hosts.yaml file

```
---
eos-1:
    hostname: '172.17.0.2'
    port: 22
    username: 'admin'
    password: 'admin'
    platform: 'arista_eos'

eos-2:
    hostname: '172.17.0.3'
    port: 22
    username: 'admin'
    password: 'admin'
    platform: 'arista_eos'
```

- Create the following show_version.py file

```
#!/usr/bin/env python
from nornir import InitNornir
from nornir_netmiko import netmiko_send_command
from nornir_utils.plugins.functions import print_result

# Initialize Nornir, by default it will look for the 
# hosts.yaml file in the same directory. 
nr = InitNornir()

# Run the show version command for each of the devices. 
# store the value in the results variable. 
result = nr.run(
    task=netmiko_send_command,
    command_string="show version"
)

# print the results in 
print_result(result)
```

- You should see the following result:
